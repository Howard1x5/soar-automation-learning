# SOAR Automation Learning

## 1. Overview
Hands-on certification prep and workflow development across major SOAR platforms. This repository documents notes, playbooks, workflows, and automation exercises to build real-world skills and showcase implementation readiness.

## 2. Platforms Covered

- **Torq Academy**
- **Splunk SOAR (SCAD)**
- **Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR (PCSAE)**
- **Microsoft Sentinel Automation**
