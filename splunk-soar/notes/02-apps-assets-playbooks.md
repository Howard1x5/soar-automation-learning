# 02 – Apps, Assets, and Playbooks

This section aligns with Splunk’s *Administering Splunk SOAR* course, Topic 2: Apps, Assets, and Playbooks.

The goal of this section is to understand how data enters Splunk SOAR, how integrations are configured, and how playbooks orchestrate actions across tools.

Hands-on configuration and playbook development will be added incrementally after the SOAR environment is available.
