# 03 – Customization and Monitoring

This section aligns with Splunk’s *Administering Splunk SOAR* course, Topic 3: Customization and Monitoring.

The goal of this section is to understand how Splunk SOAR is tailored to an organization’s workflow and how the platform is monitored and audited over time.

This section focuses on operability, observability, and long-term maintenance.

## Topic Scope (from Splunk course outline)

- Create custom severity levels
- Create custom status levels
- Add custom fields and CEF settings
- Create custom workbooks
- Run reports
- Use SOAR audit tools
- Monitor system health

## Notes / Focus Areas

- When customization helps vs hurts clarity
- How custom fields propagate through containers and artifacts
- Audit logs for failed actions and playbooks
- Monitoring for integration degradation over time
- Signals that indicate systemic issues vs one-off failures

(To be expanded with screenshots and operational examples.)
