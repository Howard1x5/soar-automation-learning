# Splunk Account and Licensing Status

## Current State
- Existing Splunk account is tied to a former employer email.
- Certification history is associated with this account.
- Email address cannot be changed via self-service UI.

## Action Taken
- Contacted Splunk Education Support to request email address change.
- Requested preservation of all certification records.

## Next Steps (Pending)
- Wait for confirmation from Splunk that account email has been updated.
- Once resolved:
  - Download local Splunk Enterprise (free license tier).
  - Install locally for Splunk SOAR integration testing.

## Notes
- Do not create a new Splunk account.
- Do not download Splunk under a different email until this is resolved.
